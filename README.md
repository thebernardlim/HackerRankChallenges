# HackerRankChallenges

Discovered HackerRank not too long ago and find it extremely fun and a pretty good way to sharpen my programming skills. 
Hoping my solutions here will be of good use to those who require any help and also for my future references.

Most of my solutions will probably be in C# and T-SQL. 

Feel free to comment / feedback too!
